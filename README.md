# HackerRank Challenges
Much like my CodeSignal repo, this is a collection of my currently completed challenges from HackerRank that I'll try to keep updated as I continue through them.

Again, I may also go back and try and port some of my solutions to various other languages further down the line as an educational exercise.

Some of these solutions may not be the sleekest, most elegant snippets of code, however I'll try to avoid altering my solutions after the fact in the interest of transparency and to try and accurately portray my skills.
